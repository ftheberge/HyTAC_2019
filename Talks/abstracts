Hypergraph Modularities and Clustering
François Théberge, TIMC and University of Ottawa

Several graph clustering algorithms rely on the graph modularity measure to find good partitions of the vertices. 
In the first part of the talk, we briefly review graph modularity and how it relates to the Chung-Lu model. 
We show that the Chung-Lu model can be naturally extended to hypergraphs, leading to new definitions of hypergraph modularity. 
We present a simple hypergraph clustering algorithm based on one such definition.
Next, we re-visit the commonly used definitions of graph and hypergraph Laplacian, as they appear in unsupervised 
and semi-supervised problems. For hypergraphs, we show that it is equivalent to a random walk on the vertices, 
leading to a re-definition of the problems on weighted graphs. This approach has been proposed recently to define a 
pseudo-hypergraph modularity, which can be used in graph-based clustering algorithms such as the Louvain algorithm. 
We discuss this approach, as well as other ideas and open questions.
